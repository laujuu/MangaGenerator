However, his style in Tae Kwon Do is a bit unorthodox. He decides to participate to the competition called God of High School (GOH) after receiving a personal invitation.
The competition seeks to find the best style and the best fighter in martial artist. The big prize for the winner of the high school martial arts completion is 1 million dollars and a wish. Mori Jin, throughout the competition, allies with some strong fighters such as Mi-Ra Yu (17, Kendo) and Dae-Wi Han (Karate).
The artwork in this Korean manga is among the best. However, this is typical for manga produced in Korea, especially those hosted by Naver. The graphics are in full color and feature modern CG/shading. In this manga series colors are used with high skills in order to better distinguish personages. The Korean manga series features many personages that are introduced but they have only some small roles in the plot’s progression.
The the story focuses on Jin Mo-Ri\’s goals of becoming the best martial arts practitioner of Renewal Taekwondo. Various twists in the plot ensue. The story really gets better and better with each new chapter or episode.

    <string name="summary0332">Gabimaru the Empty, a former ninja assassin known feared as a heartless husk of a man, spends his days on death row wondering when an executioner skilled enough to so much as harm him will arrive, as he thinks nothing of seeing an end to his meaningless existence… Or so he thought. Then the lady executioner, Asaemon the Beheader, rekindles his hope with an astounding proposition. If he ever wishes to see his beloved wife again, he is, under the auspices of the shogunate, to embark on a perilous voyage to the mysterious mystic island said to house the elixir of immortality. Should he be the one among many rival death-row fiends and scoundrels to find the elixir, he’ll earn a full exoneration, and, more importantly, a chance at an ordinary married life with the light of his life—the woman who made the world seem not so ugly. What awaits them is a journey like no other!</string>

    <string name="summary0369">A group of friends during their Senior Trip upon the cruise ship Victoria, suddenly get pulled back in time and separated. The main character, Hayumi Natsuki, arrives in the year 1636. In Japanese history, Christian rebels revolted in 1637, led by a young man known as Amakusa Shirou, resulting in thousands of casualties. However, when Natsuki arrives in the past, she and her friend Eri discover that Shirou Tokisada is already dead. Meanwhile Natsuki, according to the village folk and Shirou\'s parents, looks exactly like their late son (never mind the fact that Natsuki is female). Natsuki, the kendo champion of her school, heir to her family\'s Hakuhouryuu kendo style, simply cannot stand by and watch innocent people be persecuted simply because they are Christian. Soon she even becomes known as an angel, sent from God, whose coming was prophesized 25 years before. But what will she do when old friends become new enemies?</string>
